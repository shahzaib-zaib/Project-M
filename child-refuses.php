                                <p>When children completely refuse to go to school this can be extremely distressing for all parties.  It is often accompanied by melt-downs, physical complaints such as stomach aches, headaches, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, pleading or begging to stay at home and even young people threatening to harm themselves if they are made to go to school.</p>
                                <p>The behaviours associated with school refusal are extremely stressful for the young people, parents and siblings, and are of concern for the school and teachers.  For the young person, it has a significant negative effect on their academic and social development, and can lead to them completely dropping out of school, possibly causing significant consequences for future employment.</p>
                                <p>Paige Fujiu-Baird, Clinical Psychologist and Psychotherapist, will be speaking about meeting the challenges of school refusal at the Virtual SEND Conference to empower parents with support and guidance when seeking help for their children.  Here, she outlines her approach to supporting children to engage with their education and return to school.</p>

                                <h5>What is school refusal?</h5>
                                <p>School refusal is child-motivated refusal to attend school or difficulties in remaining in school the entire day.  School refusal is a condition characterised by reluctance or refusal to go to school by a child who:</p>
                                <dl>
                                    <li>Seeks the comfort and security of home, preferring to remain close to parental figures</li>
                                    <li>Displays evidence of emotional upset or unexplained physical symptoms at the prospect of going to school</li>
                                    <li>Manifests no severe antisocial tendencies</li>
                                    <li>Does not attempt to conceal the problem from parents or caregivers</li>
                                </dl>

                                <h5>Why do children refuse to attend school?</h5>
                                <p>The root cause of school refusal is anxiety, which will look very different according to the age of the child.  Younger children may be more anxious about being separated from caregivers, fear a teacher, or fear being picked on by older children. Frequently older school refusers have concerns about academic performance, worries about making friends, eating in the cafeteria, using the school bathroom, changing for gym, being called on for class, or being made fun of by peers. For some children there are legitimate fears of being bullied, gangs, school violence, or being ostracized and ridiculed.</p>
                                <p>Other reasons may include:</p>
                                <dl>
                                    <li>A history of physical and emotional separations that create an underlying anxiety about being away from home or parental figures.</li>
                                    <li>The fear of losing a parent through illness, divorce, or death. Fear of physical and emotional abandonment may make it difficult for the child to have their parents out of their sight and out of their control.</li>
                                    <li>Changes in the stability of the family system at home and in the family, such as frequent deaths in the family, divorce, moves to a new house, separations, transfers to another job or community, or jealously of new siblings.</li>
                                </dl>

                                <h5>What kinds of support and treatment are effective for school refusers?</h5>
                                <dl>
                                    <li>Get back into school - perhaps surprising for some, the number one factor increasing the likelihood of success with children who can’t or won’t go to school is an early return to the physical environment of school.  Identifying particular classes which the child can attend, identifying a limited time period where the child is required to be in the building, or identifying certain days which the child must attend are all legitimate strategies to employ and starting points for intervention goals and objectives.</li>
                                    <li>Therapy is helpful to address the underlying mental health issues - Depending on the situation, therapy can be individual, family, or couples sessions. A 2003 study showed that 83% of children with school refusal behaviours treated with cognitive therapy were attending school at the one year follow-up.  Other treatments may also be necessary, such as medication, family therapy, or educational interventions for learning disorders or classroom misbehaviour as appropriate and necessary.  Each solution must be tailored to the needs and concerns of the child.</li>
