                            <p>If you feel unhappy at any point with our service then please do not hesitate to call us directly and we will review the situation with you and address the issue immediately.</p>

                            <p>There are no guarantees with psychiatry. I work in this field because I have seen people achieve tremendous gains form this kind of work. That doesn't mean that I can guarantee that every person will be helped, but if what you need is something that I can help with then I will use the best available treatments to do my utmost to help.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>My phone is answered between the hours of 9 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday and 9:30 am to 3:30 pm on Saturdays, but you can leave a message outside of these hours and someone will call you back when I am open.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Most of my residential treatment enquiries for addictions and alcoholism start with a call from a family member, friend or employer. I have dealt with every kind of difficult situation and I am happy to help you do what can be done. Sometimes if the person is unwilling to address their problem then you may not be able to do anything about them, but I can help and advise you about how to look after yourself and any other people who are being affected, and also how to start to bring pressure to bear on the person so that hopefully they will be willing to get some help.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>It's a very wide range, but the main theme is that I am here to help with anything that is troubling you in your mind; whether it's a slight worry that just needs a little help, through to more serious issues. One thing I won't do is tell you I can help if I can't, so feel free to call me and I can talk it through with you.</p>

                        <a>What is the cancellation policy?</a>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Please contact me as soon as possible to let me know if you would like to cancel an appointment. Cancellations with less than 48 but more than 24 hours’ notice are usually charged at half price.</p>
                            <p>Regrettably, cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice before the appointment or non-attended appointments without any prior notice are charged at the full price.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>All of the conversations and appointments that you have with me are confidential. The exception to this is if you pose a danger to yourself or others. At this point the relevant parties will be informed.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>The length of session depends on the situation. For an initial assessment with a Psychiatrist of Psychologist this could last 90 minutes.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Yes, you can pay by calling _______. I accept all major credit cards but do not accept cash or cheques.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>If you call me and let me know what you need, I'll be happy to let you know what can be covered.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>If I need to prescribe medication for you then you will be informed of any costs in advance. Some medications are very expensive, and so we may recommend that you contact the NHS as soon as you can to access these more cost effectively.</p>

                            <p>Mental health services always seem to be pretty expensive, because they almost always involve focussed one to one time with someone with a high degree of training. I do my best to keep my fees as low as I can so that you can afford the help you want.</p>

                            <p>If you find it difficult to understand your treatment or care needed or if you find it hard speak up, there are independent people who can act as a spokesperson for you. <br>
                            They make sure you're heard and your wellbeing is protected: they are called advocates.</p>
